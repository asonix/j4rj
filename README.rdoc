== README

This application's main purpose is to expand my knowledge of Ruby and Rails. A benefit of working on this specific project is that I also get a neat wordpress-like result.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby v2.2.2p95 with Rails v4.2.1

* Depends: libxslt development package, libxml2 development packages, Postgresql v9.3
